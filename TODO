Server
======
Tasks:
- Change authentication mechanism (use 1 byte for header),
   and the same algoritm as for the message decoding. Use binary to term
- Implement unit tests


Improvements:
- Write a proper lager config
- Add sys.conf and enable it
- Enable ssl support.



Client
======
0. Use gen:server instead of low-level parallel programming
1. Implement decoding that works the same way as the server
